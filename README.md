### Week 4: Data Visualization and Presentation

#### Overview

* Applied key concepts from the module, including exploratory vs explanatory visualization, ethical storytelling, and design principles, to real datasets.
* Practiced communicating insights clearly through data-driven narratives using visual tools.

#### Post-session Work

This section demonstrates the practical implementation of what I learned throughout the week:

`notebooks/`

* **`EDA_on_employee_dataset.ipynb`**
  Explored a synthetic employee dataset to uncover trends in gender distribution, departments, job satisfaction, and salary levels.

  * Used grouped bar charts, histograms, and count plots to reveal internal company patterns.
  * Focused on visual clarity, audience relevance, and presentation flow.

* **`EDA_on_seaborn_tips_dataset.ipynb`**
  Performed structured exploratory and explanatory visualizations on Seaborn’s `tips` dataset.

  * Key findings:

    * Dinner tips are generally higher than lunch
    * Male and non-smoking customers tend to tip more
    * Larger groups tip more in total but less per person
    * Tips peak on weekends, especially Saturday and Sunday
  * Applied storytelling techniques and the assertion-evidence framework to communicate insights effectively.

These notebooks reflect a complete cycle of insight generation, visual encoding, and narrative construction.

#### Key Insight

> I learned that effective visual storytelling transforms exploration into impact. When combined with thoughtful design, even simple data can tell powerful stories.
