### 🔹 Week 4: Data Visualization & Presentation

#### 📌 Overview  
‣ Understand two key purposes of data visualization: **exploratory analysis** (discovering insights) and **explanatory analysis** (communicating findings).  
‣ Learn chart selection, ethical data presentation, and storytelling principles using Python visualization libraries.

---

#### 🧰 Pre-session Work  
‣ Explored visualization foundations and design principles: color theory, typography, layout, and the ethics of accurate representation.  
‣ Practiced EDA using libraries like **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Pandas** on two real-world datasets:
- `heart_disease_analysis.ipynb`: Investigated health-related trends in a heart disease dataset.
- `roller_coasterEDA.ipynb`: Explored roller coaster statistics using visual summaries.

📁 Location: `pression_work/`  
📁 Data: `data/coaster_db.csv`, `data/heart_2020_cleaned.csv`

---

#### 🧠 Live Session  
‣ Practiced visualizing one-dimensional, two-dimensional, and multi-dimensional data using grouped plots, heatmaps, and correlation charts.  
‣ Emphasized distinction and balance between exploratory and explanatory visualization types.  
‣ Built visual narratives from raw datasets using an **assertion-evidence framework**.

---

#### 📝 Post-session Tasks  
‣ Applied storytelling principles and best practices in two independent visual analyses:
- `EDA_on_employee_dataset.ipynb`: Focused on department-wise insights, job satisfaction, and salary bands.
- `EDA_on_seaborn_tips_dataset.ipynb`: Created both exploratory and explanatory visualizations on tipping behavior.

📁 Location: `postsession_work/`

---

#### 💡 Key Insight  
‣ Effective visualization and ethical storytelling bridge the gap between data and decisions—turning raw numbers into narratives that inform, persuade, and inspire.
