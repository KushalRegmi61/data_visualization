### 🔹 Week 4: Data Visualization & Presentation

#### 📌 Overview  
‣ Applied key concepts from the module—exploratory vs explanatory visualization, ethical storytelling, and design principles—to real datasets.  
‣ Practiced communicating insights clearly through data-driven narratives using visual tools.

#### 📝 Post-session Work

This section demonstrates the practical implementation of what I learned throughout the week:

📁 `notebooks/`

- **`EDA_on_employee_dataset.ipynb`**  
  Explored a synthetic employee dataset to uncover trends in gender distribution, departments, job satisfaction, and salary levels.  
  ‣ Used grouped bar charts, histograms, and count plots to reveal internal company patterns.  
  ‣ Focused on visual clarity, audience relevance, and presentation flow.

- **`EDA_on_seaborn_tips_dataset.ipynb`**  
  Performed structured exploratory and explanatory visualizations on Seaborn’s `tips` dataset.  
  ‣ Key findings:  
    - Dinner tips are generally higher than lunch  
    - Male and non-smoking customers tend to tip more  
    - Larger groups tip more in total but less per person  
    - Tips peak on weekends, especially Saturday and Sunday  
  ‣ Applied storytelling techniques and the assertion-evidence framework to communicate insights effectively.

These notebooks reflect a complete cycle of insight generation → visual encoding → narrative construction.

#### 💡 Key Insight  
‣ Effective visual storytelling transforms exploration into impact—when combined with thoughtful design, even simple data can tell powerful stories.
